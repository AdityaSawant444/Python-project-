Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis
This project is a beginner-oriented data analysis task using Python, where I explored and analyzed Diwali sales data to uncover patterns in customer behavior and product trends.
The main objective was to extract actionable insights that could help enhance customer experience and increase sales.
Throughout the project, I worked with data cleaning, visualization, and interpretation using libraries like pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn.
